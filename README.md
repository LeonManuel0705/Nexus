# Nexus

**A unified productivity system that replaces five apps with one.** Nexus brings together calendar, tasks, email, school management, transit routing, and more, all running locally on your device with zero cloud dependency.

I built Nexus because I was tired of switching between separate apps for school, calendar, transit, and tasks. Instead of stitching together tools that don't talk to each other, I wanted one system that understands how these things connect: a cancelled class means a changed commute, a new homework assignment becomes a task with a deadline, and a calendar event shows the route to get there.

## What it does

Nexus is a full stack productivity system spanning three platforms:

**Mobile App** (Flutter). Native Android/iOS app with offline first architecture. 22 screens covering dashboard, tasks, calendar, email, school timetable, transit routing, training tracker, notes, bookmarks, spaced repetition, and a Pomodoro timer. State management via Provider, local storage with SQLite and Hive, background sync via WorkManager.

**Web Dashboard** (Flask). Browser based interface with real time WebSocket updates, Google OAuth, and Progressive Web App support. Serves 80+ API endpoints across 27 database tables. Handles Google Calendar sync, Gmail integration, IServ school system connectivity, CalDAV, and VBB transit routing with personalized recommendations.

**Landing Page** (Vite and Tailwind CSS v4). Marketing site with multi language support (EN/DE), screenshot gallery, smooth scroll animations, and static export for Netlify.

**Desktop App** (Electron). Bundles the Flask backend with a local HTTP server for Windows and Linux distribution.

## Architecture decisions

* **Privacy first.** All data stays on device. Credentials are encrypted at rest using Fernet with PBKDF2 (600k iterations, salts per file). No telemetry, no accounts required.
* **Offline first.** The Flutter app works fully without network access. SQLite for structured data, Hive for encrypted key value storage. Background sync picks up when connectivity returns.
* **Security hardened.** OAuth CSRF protection, CSP headers, SSRF validation on CalDAV/email hosts, CRLF header injection prevention, rate limiting, input sanitization across all 80+ endpoints.
* **Transparent migration.** `decrypt_file()` detects plaintext JSON and legacy encryption schemes, and re encrypts in place without user intervention.
